# Concussion-Project
A Simple project that demonstrated concussions to kids. Actual project needs art.
All this project ever did was dim some LED's when a Soft Potentiometer was hit, so really this base could be used for anything that is touch sesative that uses an analog value between 1 and 1023 and needs LED's to dim.
